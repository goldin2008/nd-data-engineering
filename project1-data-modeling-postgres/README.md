# Project 1 - Data Modeling with PostgreSQL

## Introduction

The company Sparkify needs to get insights from the log files based on the users using his app. In this
case they are interested in analyze what songs users are listening to. Because the log data in his current
format is not easy to analyze, the need to implement an ETL process to generate one fact table and some dimensional tables. This kind of star schema database is very suitable for analytics purposes.

The pipeline contains the following processes:

1. Define database tables with dimension and fact structure.
2. Load json data from multiple data sources.
3. Preprocess the raw data in order to meet star schema structure requirements.
4. Insert data to the defined table.

_The content of the following section is from the project statement provided by Udacity._

>A startup called Sparkify wants to analyze the data they've been collecting on songs and user activity on their new music streaming app. The analytics team is particularly interested in understanding what songs users are listening to. Currently, they don't have an easy way to query their data, which resides in a directory of JSON logs on user activity on the app, as well as a directory with JSON metadata on the songs in their app.
>
>They'd like a data engineer to create a Postgres database with tables designed to optimize queries on song play analysis, and bring you on the project. Your role is to create a database schema and ETL pipeline for this analysis. You'll be able to test your database and ETL pipeline by running queries given to you by the analytics team from Sparkify and compare your results with their expected results.

## Project Datasets

_The content of the following section is from the project statement provided by Udacity._

### Song Dataset

> The first dataset is a subset of real data from the [Million Song Dataset](https://labrosa.ee.columbia.edu/millionsong/). Each file is in JSON format and contains metadata about a song and the artist of that song. The files are partitioned by the first three letters of each song's track ID. For example, here are filepaths to two files in this dataset.

```txt
song_data/A/B/C/TRABCEI128F424C983.json
song_data/A/A/B/TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json
```

> And below is an example of what a single song file, TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json, looks like.

```json
{"num_songs": 1, "artist_id": "ARJIE2Y1187B994AB7", "artist_latitude": null, "artist_longitude": null, "artist_location": "", "artist_name": "Line Renaud", "song_id": "SOUPIRU12A6D4FA1E1", "title": "Der Kleine Dompfaff", "duration": 152.92036, "year": 0}
```

### Log Dataset

> The second dataset consists of log files in JSON format generated by this [event simulator](https://github.com/Interana/eventsim) based on the songs in the dataset above. These simulate activity logs from a music streaming app based on specified configurations.

> The log files in the dataset you'll be working with are partitioned by year and month. For example, here are filepaths to two files in this dataset.

```shell
log_data/2018/11/2018-11-12-events.json
log_data/2018/11/2018-11-13-events.json
```

> And below is an example of what the data in a log file, 2018-11-12-events.json, looks like.

![log-data](./images/log-data.png)

If you would like to look at the JSON data within log_data files, you will need to create a pandas dataframe to read the data. Remember to first import JSON and pandas libraries.
```
df = pd.read_json(filepath, lines=True)
```

For example,
```
df = pd.read_json('data/log_data/2018/11/2018-11-01-events.json', lines=True)
```
would read the data file 2018-11-01-events.json.

## Database Schema design

[![songplay_analysis_schema](./images/songplay_analysis_schema.png)](https://dbdiagram.io/d/5ecff07d39d18f5553ffe9ca)

As you can see from the diagram above (click on the image for further details) we are using a **Star schema** with `songplays` as a **fact** table and references `users`, `songs`, `artists` and `time` as **dimension** tables.

The `songplays` fact table consists of the user activity on the music streaming app. The purpose is to analyze the songs users are listening to.

The dimension tables allows us to categorize facts and measures in order to allow the analytics team answer business questions. Using such a schema allows the team to use simplified queries and fast aggregations compared to normalized tables.

Examples of business questions and their corresponding queries that answer them are provided in the [Example queries](#example-queries) section.



**Note**: the `songs` table reference the `artists` table using `artist_id` as a foreign key. This is called an _outrigger dimensions_ and is considered a data-warehouse anti-pattern. However, this was part of the project specifications to design the schema this way. A better practice would be to relate those two dimensions using a fact table.

## ETL pipeline

The main goals of the ETL pipeline were to:

- extract the data from the `.json` files

-  transform empty string values `''` , `nan` float values and `0` values for the field _year_ to Python `None` value that would then replaced by `NULL` in the PostgreSQL tables using the **psycopg2** Python database adapter
- load the values into the tables

A detailed explanation of the ETL pipeline can be found in the [etl.ipynb](etl.ipynb) Python Notebook.

## How to run the Python scripts
The following instructions will help you set up the database, create the tables and run the ETL pipeline to populate them with the data that is stored in json format.

### Prerequisites
#### PostgreSQL, `sparkify` database and `student` user

You must have **PostgreSQL** installed on your machine.

On **macOS** use the following commands:

```shell
brew update
brew install postgresql
```

On a **Unix** system use the following:

```shell
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get instal postgresql postgresql-contrib
```

Furthermore, a `student` user and a `sparkify` database must be created.

You can use the following commands to do this (enter `student` as a password when the prompted):

```shell
createuser student --createdb --pwprompt
createdb sparkify -U student
```

#### Python packages

The `psycopg2` and `pandas` packages must be installed on your machine.

Use the [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/) package installer to install these:

```shell
pip3 install psycopg2 pandas
```

#### Create table and run ETL

1. Create the tables in the `sparkify` database by running the `create_tables.py` Python 3 script:

```shell
python3 create_tables.py
```

2. Run the ETL pipelines to populate the newly created tables by running  `etl.py` Python 3 script:

```shell
python3 etl.py
```

Alternatively, you can run the cells in the `etl.ipynb` if you prefer to go through the code step by step.

## Running the tests

To check that the database was properly created you can run the cells in the `test.ipynb`. This Python Notebook connects to the local `sparkify` database using the `student ` use. It then displays the first 5 rows for each table.

## Files in the repository
*Project Template*
To get started with the project, go to the workspace on the next page, where you'll find the project template files. You can work on your project and submit your work through this workspace. Alternatively, you can download the project template files from the Resources folder if you'd like to develop your project locally.

In addition to the data files, the project workspace includes six files:

1. test.ipynb displays the first few rows of each table to let you check your database.
2. create_tables.py drops and creates your tables. You run this file to reset your tables before each time you run your ETL scripts.
3. etl.ipynb reads and processes a single file from song_data and log_data and loads the data into your tables. This notebook contains detailed instructions on the ETL process for each of the tables.
4. etl.py reads and processes files from song_data and log_data and loads them into your tables. You can fill this out based on your work in the ETL notebook.
5. sql_queries.py contains all your sql queries, and is imported into the last three files above.
6. README.md provides discussion on your project.

## Requirement

This project assumes that you can connect postgreSQL database. If you setup your own database server, you should fix connection parameters which are hard coded in the source codes such as `conn = psycopg2.connect("host=127.0.0.1 dbname=studentdb user=student password=student")`.

The dependencies are defined in `requirements.txt`. In the project's directory, the following command will install required dependencies.

```
pip3 install pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## About Table Schema

### Table Definition

In this project, the following tables are defined.Processed data are stored in a relational database system (PostgreSQL). This database have multiple dimensional table and single fact table. The schema difines the following tables.

### Schema of database : **sparkifydb**
The database **sparkifydb** consist of 5 tables, and their columns are given below:
#### Fact Table
1.	**songplays** - records in log data associated with song plays
    - *songplay_id*, int, the id of song played
    - *start_time*, varchar, start time of song played

    - *artist_id*, varchar, artist id
    - *name*, varchar, artist name
    - *location*, varchar, location of artist
    - *latitude*, numeric, latitude of artist's location
    - *longitude*, numeric, longitude of artist's location
5.	**time** - timestamps of records in songplays broken down into specific units
    - *start_time*, varchar, timestamp of start time of song played
    - *hour*, int, hour in a day of *start_time*
    - *day*, int, day in a month of *start_time*

    - *month*, int, month of *start_time*
    - *year*, int, year of *start_time*
    - *weekday*, int, weekday of *start_time*

*Project Steps*
Below are steps you can follow to complete the project:

*Create Tables*
1. Write CREATE statements in sql_queries.py to create each table.
2. Write DROP statements in sql_queries.py to drop each table if it exists.
3. Run create_tables.py to create your database and tables.
4. Run test.ipynb to confirm the creation of your tables with the correct columns. Make sure to click "Restart kernel" to close the connection to the database after running this notebook.

*Build ETL Processes*
Follow instructions in the etl.ipynb notebook to develop ETL processes for each table. At the end of each table section, or at the end of the notebook, run test.ipynb to confirm that records were successfully inserted into each table. Remember to rerun create_tables.py to reset your tables before each time you run this notebook.

*Build ETL Pipeline*
Use what you've completed in etl.ipynb to complete etl.py, where you'll process the entire datasets. Remember to run create_tables.py before running etl.py to reset your tables. Run test.ipynb to confirm your records were successfully inserted into each table.

*Document Process*
Do the following steps in your README.md file.

1. Discuss the purpose of this database in the context of the startup, Sparkify, and their analytical goals.
2. State and justify your database schema design and ETL pipeline.
3. [Optional] Provide example queries and results for song play analysis.
Here's a guide on Markdown Syntax.

NOTE: You will not be able to run test.ipynb, etl.ipynb, or etl.py until you have run create_tables.py at least once to create the sparkifydb database, which these other files connect to.
